# World-Bank-Data

World Bank Data Visualization

This project aims to reproduce the visualizations created by Hans Rosling in his TED talk titled "The best stats you've ever seen" using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

In 2006, Hans Rosling delivered a captivating TED talk where he used data visualizations to debunk misconceptions about global health and development.
One of the key visualizations in his talk was an animation depicting the relationship between life expectancy, fertility rate, and population for various countries over time.

Before working on the project, it is highly recommended to watch Hans Rosling's TED talk

Hans Rosling's visualization aimed to challenge the misconception that the world is divided into two distinct groups: the "Western world" with low fertility rates and high life expectancy, and the "third world" with high fertility rates and low life expectancy.
